# Node Sqlite Sample

This is a sample project that incorperates a database layer in sqlite.  It has db init if tables are not created and then a sample of a db layer with sub layers for business objects like cars.

It is very basic but will be used in a web server with a crud layer using the business objects in the end.

This is a basic example of an sqlite database with web Api crud.
